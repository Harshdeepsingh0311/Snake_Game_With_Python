# Snake Game In Python (Using Turtle Module)

This Snake Game is created by Harshdeep Singh in a python module named as turtle. This is practice game development in python project done by me to get familiar with some game development stuffs in python.

Developed by Harshdeep Singh (c) 2021

## Basic Logic 

The Basic Logic behind this game is there is a head of the snake and the food, and as soon as the head collides with the food, the food is dissappeared and one circle shaped segment of snake sticks to it's head.

The important and difficult step is to populate segments of the snake as soon as he eats the food. I have achieved it by providing the criterion how the snake will collide with the food that is if distance between the food and the head of the snake becomes less than 20 pixel(half of width of a shape in turtle) the food is placed outside the screen and then each segment of the snake acts as a element of a list which gets appended by another element when the above condition becomes true. 

**Feel free to ask any query related to anything and use the code for the same, you can improve this game by raising issues and solving it. These two concepts are neccesary to create this game like i did, There can be many approaches to achieve but i sought out this so i made my game like this only. Looking towards for your cooperation.....**
